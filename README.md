# EGTrans
EG-TransAttention: Edge-aware multiscale attention network for predicting circRNA-disease associations

## Description
EG-TransAttention is a deep learning framework designed to predict potential associations between circular RNAs (circRNAs) and diseases. It integrates edge-aware multiscale attention mechanisms to capture both local and global topological features from heterogeneous biological networks. The model combines graph convolutional operations with edge-guided attention to enhance representation learning and improve prediction accuracy.

## Dataset Information

The `datasets` folder contains the processed circRNA–disease association data, similarity matrices, and name mapping files used for training and evaluation.

### Data Source
The data is collected and integrated from the **circR2Disease** and **circRNADisease** databases, then processed into:
- circRNA–circRNA similarity matrices
- disease–disease similarity matrices
- circRNA–disease association matrices
- circRNA/disease name mapping files

These files are loaded automatically by `load_data.py` during training.


## Code Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point for training and evaluation  
- `train1.py`: Training loop and model optimization  
- `model.py`: Defines EG-TransAttention architecture and attention modules  
- `load_data.py`: Loads and preprocesses circRNA-disease data  
- `param.py`: Contains hyperparameters and configuration settings  
- `evaluation_scores.py`: Computes evaluation metrics (AUC, accuracy, F1-score, etc.)  
- `MA.py` / `PA.py`: Implements multiscale attention and Parnet attention  
 
## Usage Instructions
  Run main.py directly to do CDA tasks.

- Prepare the Dataset

  Download circRNA–disease association data from circR2Disease and circRNADisease.

- Generate Fusion Similarities

  Before training, run load_data.py to preprocess the data and compute Gaussian-fused similarities:

  python load_data.py

- This will:

  Read raw matrices: c_d.csv, c_c.csv, d_d.csv.

- Compute Gaussian similarity matrices:

  GCC_similarity.csv for circRNAs

  GDD_similarity.csv for diseases

  Integrate original similarity matrices with Gaussian similarities.

  Prepare inputs for graph construction in the model.

⚠️ Make sure the paths in param.py match your dataset location.

- Set Hyperparameters

  Edit param.py to configure model parameters, such as learning rate, epochs, batch size, number of attention heads, etc.

- Run Training
  python main.py

  Loads preprocessed data from load_data.py

  Constructs heterogeneous graphs

  Trains the EG-TransAttention model

  Outputs prediction scores and learned node features
